# LiveSplit ASL Scripts
This is a collection of ASL scripts for use with LiveSplit that I have written and maintain.

- [LiveSplit](http://livesplit.github.io) - Here you can find out more about and download LiveSplit. It is a popular timer program typically used for speedruns.
- [ASL](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit/blob/master/Documentation/Auto-Splitters.md) - Here you can find more information about ASL (basically C#) and autosplitters in general.

For information about my autosplitters and how to install/use them, check their individual folders.
